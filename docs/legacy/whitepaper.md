# Yellow Network (YELLOW) Whitepaper

*In accordance with Title II of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (MiCA)*

---

## Summary

**Warning:** This summary should be read as an introduction to the crypto-asset white paper. The prospective holder should base any decision to purchase this crypto-asset on the content of the crypto-asset white paper as a whole and not on the summary alone.

As blockchain technology evolves, so does the complexity and the variety of solutions. A large amount of blockchains, tokens, and platforms has led to a silo approach that confronts users with inefficiencies and security issues, hindering scalability and mass adoption.

Yellow Network aims to address this issue by providing **Yellow Clearnet**, a virtual ledger layer-3 infrastructure that uses state channels to connect brokers across blockchains, allowing it to reach tokens locked in isolated networks without cross-chain bridging. The layer-3 is built using state-channel smart contracts (nitrolite - a simplified take on nitro) and clearnode, a golang microservice that acts as the off-chain service for state-channel ledger operations.

The matching throughput of our network averages billions of messages daily, far quicker than any Layer-1 or Layer-2 solution currently available. Our solution is an automated smart clearing protocol, comparable to the function of a clearing house in traditional finance. Yellow Network acts as a mediator between brokers, exchanges, and market makers through its chain-agnostic layer-3 infrastructure.

**NeoDAX**, built on top of the Yellow Clearnet layer, is the prominent application providing broker-to-broker trading venues. By decoupling trading and settlement through the layer-3 virtual ledger, the Yellow Network protocol enables true decentralization of high-frequency trading and widens access to digital and traditional assets.

The crypto-asset referred to in this white paper, $YELLOW, serves as the utility token for accessing and operating within the Yellow Network.

## Part I - Information on Risks

### 1.1 Offer-Related Risks
The offering of $YELLOW tokens is subject to market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. The success of the offering depends on market acceptance and the ability to raise sufficient funds to achieve the project's roadmap goals. There is no guarantee that a secondary market for $YELLOW tokens will develop or be sustained.

### 1.2 Issuer-Related Risks
Layer3 Fintech Ltd. is the primary entity behind this offering. As a company operating in the rapidly evolving blockchain space, it faces business, legal, and regulatory risks. The company's financial condition is dependent on the success of the Yellow Network project and the broader crypto market.

### 1.3 Crypto-Assets-related Risks
The crypto-asset referred to in this white paper may lose its value in part or in full, may not always be transferable and may not be liquid. The value of $YELLOW is subject to extreme volatility and can be influenced by factors such as market sentiment, technological changes, and regulatory developments. The utility of the token is tied to the Yellow Network platform; any disruption or failure of the network could adversely affect the token's value.

### 1.4 Project Implementation-Related Risks
The development and implementation of the Yellow Network are complex and subject to risks, including technical challenges, delays in the roadmap, and competition from other projects. The project's success depends on the successful deployment of its layer-3 infrastructure, state channels, and the NeoDAX application.

### 1.5 Technology-Related Risks
The Yellow Network relies on cutting-edge technologies, including state channels, smart contracts, and a decentralized P2P network. These technologies are still nascent and may have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Security breaches, hacks, or exploits of the underlying smart contracts or network infrastructure could result in significant losses for token holders.

### 1.6 Mitigation Measures
To mitigate these risks, Yellow Network employs a robust risk management framework, including:
- **Collateralization:** Requiring brokers to lock collateral to secure trading activities.
- **Dispute Resolution:** An automated dispute resolution system via smart contracts and a manual Online Dispute Resolution Center (ODRC).
- **Security Audits:** Regular security audits of smart contracts and infrastructure by reputable firms like Hacken.
- **Decentralized Custody:** Encouraging the use of diverse, non-custodial MPC TSS solutions to prevent central points of failure.

## Part F - Information about the crypto-assets

- **Crypto-Asset Type:** Utility Token (ERC-20)
- **Crypto-Asset Functionality:**
    1.  **Network Access:** Participants must lock $YELLOW tokens to open state channels and become accredited members of the network. The number of channels a participant can open is tiered based on the amount of $YELLOW locked.
    2.  **Clearing Fees:** Fees for settling trades on the network are paid in $YELLOW.
    3.  **Collateral:** $YELLOW tokens are used as access collateral, which can be slashed in case of disputes, ensuring network integrity.
- **Planned Application of Functionalities:** The functionalities are integral to the launch and operation of the Yellow Network, starting from the Canary Testnet phase and continuing through the mainnet launch and beyond, as outlined in the project roadmap.

## Part G - Information on the rights and obligations attached to the crypto-assets

- **Purchaser Rights and Obligations:** Holders of $YELLOW tokens have the right to use them for their intended utility within the Yellow Network. They are obligated to adhere to the network's terms and conditions. The token does not represent ownership or equity in Layer3 Fintech Ltd. or its affiliates.
- **Utility Tokens Redemption:** The utility token is not exchangeable against the good or service promised in the crypto-asset white paper, especially in the case of a failure or discontinuation of the crypto-asset project. It is used to access services, not redeemed for them.
- **Token Value Protection Schemes:** The Yellow Treasury Vault collects network fees and implements a buy-back mechanism for the $YELLOW token to provide stability and liquidity. The Treasury may also burn tokens to support valuation.

## Part H - Information on the underlying technology

- **Distributed ledger technology:** The $YELLOW token is an ERC-20 token initially on the Ethereum blockchain, with plans to support Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, Linea, and BNB Chain. The Yellow Network itself is a Layer-3 overlay network, not a new blockchain.
- **Technology Used:** The network uses a P2P mesh network of "clearnodes" (Golang microservices) and state-channel smart contracts ("nitrolite"). This architecture enables high-speed off-chain communication and trade liability exchange, with periodic on-chain settlement.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** The underlying blockchains' consensus mechanisms (e.g., Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake) secure the on-chain components (token and smart contracts). Off-chain state transitions within channels are agreed upon and signed by the involved participants.
- **Incentive Mechanisms and Applicable Fees:**
    - **Liquidity Fee (L1):** Negotiated P2P between brokers to incentivize market-making.
    - **Clearing Fee (L2):** Paid by both parties in a trade to the Yellow Treasury Vault in $YELLOW tokens. Fees are tiered based on the amount of $YELLOW staked.
- **Audit:** The technology has been audited by Hacken, receiving a score of 10/10. Further audits are planned closer to the Token Generation Event (TGE).
