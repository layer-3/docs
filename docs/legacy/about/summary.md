# ðŸ“Œ Summary

As blockchain technology evolves, so does the complexity and the variety of solutions.

At Yellow Network we are committed to making cryptocurrency trading lean, efficient, and secure.

A large amount of blockchains, tokens, and platforms has led to a silo approach that confronts users with inefficiencies and security issues, hindering scalability and mass adoption.

Yellow Network aims to address this issue by providing **Yellow Clearnet**, a virtual ledger layer-3 infrastructure that uses state channels to connect brokers across blockchains, allowing it to reach tokens locked in isolated networks without cross-chain bridging. The layer-3 is built using state-channel smart contracts (nitrolite - a simplified take on nitro) and clearnode, a golang microservice that acts as the off-chain service for state-channel ledger operations.

The matching throughput of our network averages billions of messages daily, far quicker than any Layer-1 or Layer-2 solution currently available. Our solution is an automated smart clearing protocol, comparable to the function of a clearing house in traditional finance. Yellow Network acts as a mediator between brokers, exchanges, and market makers through its chain-agnostic layer-3 infrastructure.

**NeoDAX**, built on top of the Yellow Clearnet layer, is the prominent application providing broker-to-broker trading venues. The layer-3 virtual ledger allows rapid development of DEX platforms like NeoDAX with lower CAPEX and OPEX, enabling builders to create fast DeFi applications with the SDK made available through multiple Hackathons.

By decoupling trading and settlement through the layer-3 virtual ledger, the Yellow Network protocol enables true decentralization of high-frequency trading and widens access to digital and traditional assets.
