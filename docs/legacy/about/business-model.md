Yellow Network is a non-profit project that seeks to solve the problem of truly decentralized trading by allowing participants to swap assets across different exchanges without having to rely on block creation. This brings all parties, exchanges, blockchains, and trading firms together, creating a network of brokerages and allowing for a more efficient trading infrastructure. Additionally, it unifies all chains into a virtual ledger layer to allow instant settlement and trade information exchange.

[Sustainable Token Ecosystem](business-model.md#sustainable-token-ecosystem)

_**Our global strategy is to have 1,000+ participants operating globally on the network by 2028.**_

## Sustainable Token Ecosystem

Our [$YELLOW](../../legacy/usdyellow/tokenomics.md) token serves as the gateway to Yellow Network. Participant must lock $YELLOW to access the state-channel infrastructure.

Participant collateral amount can be slashed in case of online dispute loss. Any participant can file a dispute against another participant for a filing fee. An independent arbitration board consult the audit trails available and enforce the outcome of the dispute which may result in a reputation fault, but also a token slash. Reputation and dispute are recorded on-chain in a participant registry.

Transaction fees are collected from clearing and trading fees and collected into the Yellow Treasury Vault which implements buy-back mechanism of the YELLOW token to stabilize it's value throught liquidity provision.
