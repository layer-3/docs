# Yellow Treasury Vault

The **Yellow Treasury Vault** is our treasury entity and is tasked with the following main responsibilities:

1. **To provide stability for the $YELLOW token** through a buy-back mechanism
2. **Building a diversified currency reserve** to resolve disputes between brokers
3. **Collecting transaction fees** from clearing and trading fees

## Fee Collection and Buy-Back Mechanism

Transaction fees are collected from clearing and trading fees and deposited into the Yellow Treasury Vault. The vault implements a **buy-back mechanism of the $YELLOW token to stabilize its value through liquidity provision**.

$YELLOW Tokens sent to the Treasury Vault will be used to build a diversified portfolio of tokens and coins. Holding a diversified portfolio reduces market risk while at the same time enabling the vault to have a variety of currencies to settle disputes.

The Treasury Vault can decide to burn $YELLOW under certain conditions to support the valuation of the native Yellow Network token.
