## Architecture Overview

Yellow SDK is built on the **NitroliteRPC** protocol, implementing real-time communication for state channel applications. The architecture consists of:

- **NitroliteRPC**: Core messaging protocol for secure, real-time off-chain communication
- **ClearNode**: Network infrastructure for message routing, session management, and verification
- **Application Sessions**: Structured environments for multi-party interactions
- **Message Signing**: Wallet-based authentication and message integrity

This streamlined design allows developers to build real-time applications with instant messaging, secure authentication, and reliable session management.
