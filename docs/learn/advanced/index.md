# Advanced Guide

This section covers advanced topics for working with the Yellow SDK. These are intended for developers who need deeper control over the state channel operations or want to integrate with specialized systems.

**Consider using the advanced features when:**

- Building custom workflows that require more control than the high-level NitroliteClient API provides
- Integrating with smart contract wallets or other account abstraction systems
- Implementing specialized monitoring or management systems for state channels
- Developing cross-chain applications that require custom handling of state channel operations
- Optimizing gas usage through transaction batching and other techniques

## Advanced Topics

**[Architecture](./architecture)** - Deep dive into the Yellow Network architecture, understanding the core components, data flow, and system design principles that power decentralized clearing.

**[Multi-Party State Channels](./multi-party)** - Learn about implementing complex multi-party state channel operations, handling multiple participants, and managing advanced channel lifecycle events.

**[Deployment Strategies](./deployment)** - Master production deployment patterns, scaling considerations, monitoring setup, and operational best practices for Yellow Apps.

**[Security Considerations](./security)** - Understand security best practices, threat models, secure key management, and how to build robust, attack-resistant applications.
