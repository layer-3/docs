# Learn

Welcome to the Yellow Network learning path. This section builds your understanding from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

---

## Introduction

Start here to understand what Yellow Network solves and how it works.

**[What Yellow Solves](./introduction/what-yellow-solves)** — Understand the core problems: scaling, cost, and speed. Learn why state channels are the answer for high-frequency applications.

**[Architecture at a Glance](./introduction/architecture-at-a-glance)** — See how the three protocol layers (on-chain, off-chain, application) work together to enable fast, secure transactions.

---

## Getting Started

Get hands-on with Yellow Network in minutes.

**[Quickstart: Your First Channel](./getting-started/quickstart)** — Create a state channel, perform an off-chain transfer, and verify the transaction in under 10 minutes.

**[Prerequisites & Environment](./getting-started/prerequisites)** — Set up a complete development environment with Node.js, TypeScript, and the Nitrolite SDK.

**[Key Terms & Mental Models](./getting-started/key-terms)** — Build your vocabulary and conceptual framework for understanding state channels.

---

## Core Concepts

Deep dive into the technology powering Yellow Network.

**[State Channels vs L1/L2](./core-concepts/state-channels-vs-l1-l2)** — Compare state channels with Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions. Understand when each approach is the right choice.

**[App Sessions](./core-concepts/app-sessions)** — Multi-party application channels with custom governance and state management.

**[Session Keys](./core-concepts/session-keys)** — Delegated keys for secure, gasless interactions without repeated wallet prompts.

**[Challenge-Response & Disputes](./core-concepts/challenge-response)** — How Yellow Network handles disputes and ensures your funds are always recoverable.

**[Message Envelope](./core-concepts/message-envelope)** — Overview of the Nitro RPC message format and communication protocol.

---

## Next Steps

After completing the Learn section, continue to:

- **[Build](/docs/build/quick-start)** — Implement complete Yellow Applications
- **[Protocol Reference](/docs/protocol/introduction)** — Authoritative protocol specification
