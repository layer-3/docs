# Learn

Welcome to the Yellow Network learning path. This section builds your understanding from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

---

## Introduction

Start here to understand what Yellow Network solves and how it works.

**[What Yellow Solves](./introduction/what-yellow-solves.mdx)** — Understand the core problems: scaling, cost, and speed. Learn why <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.channel}>state channels</Tooltip> are the answer for high-frequency applications.

**[Architecture at a Glance](./introduction/architecture-at-a-glance.mdx)** — See how the three protocol layers (on-chain, off-chain, application) work together to enable fast, secure transactions.

---

## Getting Started

Get hands-on with Yellow Network in minutes.

**[Quickstart: Your First Channel](./getting-started/quickstart.mdx)** — Create a <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.channel}>state channel</Tooltip>, perform an off-chain transfer, and verify the transaction in under 10 minutes.

**[Prerequisites & Environment](./getting-started/prerequisites.mdx)** — Set up a complete development environment with Node.js, TypeScript, and the Nitrolite SDK.

**[Key Terms & Mental Models](./getting-started/key-terms.mdx)** — Build your vocabulary and conceptual framework for understanding <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.channel}>state channels</Tooltip>.

---

## Core Concepts

Deep dive into the technology powering Yellow Network.

**[State Channels vs L1/L2](./core-concepts/state-channels-vs-l1-l2.mdx)** — Compare state channels with Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions. Understand when each approach is the right choice.

**[App Sessions](./core-concepts/app-sessions.mdx)** — Multi-party <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.appChannel}>application channels</Tooltip> with custom governance and state management.

**[Session Keys](./core-concepts/session-keys.mdx)** — <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.sessionKey}>Delegated keys</Tooltip> for secure, gasless interactions without repeated wallet prompts.

**[Challenge-Response & Disputes](./core-concepts/challenge-response.mdx)** — How Yellow Network handles disputes and ensures your funds are always recoverable.

**[Message Envelope](./core-concepts/message-envelope.mdx)** — Overview of the Nitro RPC message format and communication protocol.
