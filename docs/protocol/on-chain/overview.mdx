# On-Chain Protocol Overview

The on-chain protocol defines the smart contract interfaces and data structures that form the foundation of <Tooltip content="The on-chain smart contract protocol.">Nitrolite's</Tooltip> security guarantees. This layer operates on the <Tooltip content="The underlying distributed ledger technology (e.g., Ethereum).">blockchain</Tooltip> and handles:

- **Fund Custody**: Secure locking and unlocking of <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel.">participant</Tooltip> assets
- **Dispute Resolution**: Challenge-response mechanism for disagreements
- **Final Settlement**: Distribution of funds according to validated <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data.">states</Tooltip>
- **<Tooltip content="A secure communication pathway between participants that locks funds in an on-chain smart contract while enabling off-chain state updates.">Channel</Tooltip> Lifecycle**: State transitions from creation to closure

## Key Responsibilities

The on-chain layer MUST provide:

1. **Deterministic <Tooltip content="A unique identifier for a channel, computed as the hash of the channel configuration.">channel identifiers</Tooltip>** computed from channel configuration
2. **Signature verification** to authenticate <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data.">state</Tooltip> updates
3. **State validation** through <Tooltip content="A smart contract that validates state transitions according to application-specific rules.">adjudicator</Tooltip> contracts
4. **Challenge periods** to ensure fair dispute resolution
5. **Fund safety** guaranteeing users can always recover their assets

:::info EVM Compatibility
The initial version of Nitrolite is designed for EVM-compatible blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and other EVM chains. Support for additional networks is continuously expanding.

## Contract Interfaces

The protocol defines three primary contract interfaces:

- **IChannel**: Core <Tooltip content="A secure communication pathway between participants that locks funds in an on-chain smart contract while enabling off-chain state updates.">channel</Tooltip> lifecycle operations (create, join, challenge, close)
- **IDeposit**: Token deposit and withdrawal management
- **IChannelReader**: Read-only queries for channel <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data.">state</Tooltip> and status

These interfaces are implemented by the <Tooltip content="The main on-chain contract implementing channel creation, joining, and closure. It is an implementation of the Nitrolite protocol.">**Custody Contract**</Tooltip>, which serves as the main entry point for on-chain operations.
