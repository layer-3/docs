# Introduction

## What is Nitrolite?

Nitrolite is a <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.channel}>state channel</Tooltip> protocol that enables off-chain interactions between <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.participant}>participants</Tooltip> with minimal on-chain operations. The protocol forms a unified virtual ledger (called "clearnet") for applications to escrow funds while being fully abstracted from the underlying blockchain.

The initial version of Nitrolite is EVM-compatible and designed for deployment on Layer 1 and Layer 2 Ethereum networks.

## Design Goals

Nitrolite is designed with the following objectives:

- **Scalability**: Move high-frequency operations off-chain
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize gas fees by reducing on-chain transactions
- **Security**: Maintain blockchain-level security guarantees
- **Interoperability**: Support multiple blockchains and assets
- **Developer Experience**: Provide clear, implementable specifications

## Protocol Layers

Nitrolite consists of three interconnected layers:

1. **On-Chain Layer**: Smart contracts that handle fund custody, dispute resolution, and final settlement
2. **Off-Chain Layer**: RPC protocol for fast, gasless <Tooltip content={tooltipDefinitions.channelState}>state</Tooltip> updates between participants
3. **Application Layer**: Arbitrary application logic built on top of the protocol

## Specification Scope

This document defines the Nitrolite protocol in a **programming language-agnostic manner**. Implementers can use these specifications to build compliant implementations in any language (Go, Python, Rust, JavaScript, etc.).

:::caution Language Independence
Implementation-specific details are referenced but not mandated by this specification. The protocol description is abstract and can be implemented in any programming language.
