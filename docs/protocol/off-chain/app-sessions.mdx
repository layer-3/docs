# App Session Methods

<Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App sessions</Tooltip> enable multi-party applications with custom governance rules, allowing complex interactions on top of payment channels.

---

## Overview

<Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App sessions</Tooltip> are off-chain channels built on top of the <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balance</Tooltip>, intended for app developers to create application-specific interactions. They act as a "box" or shared account where multiple <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> can lock funds and execute custom logic with governance rules.

### Key Features

**Multi-Party Governance**: Define custom voting weights and quorum rules for state updates.

**Application-Specific State**: Store arbitrary application data (game state, escrow conditions, etc.).

**Flexible Fund Management**: Lock, redistribute, add, or withdraw funds during session lifecycle.

**Instant Updates**: All state changes happen off-chain with zero gas fees.

:::info For App Developers
<Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App sessions</Tooltip> are specifically designed for app developers building trustless multi-party applications like games, prediction markets, escrow, and collaborative finance.
:::

---

## Protocol Versions

<Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App sessions</Tooltip> support multiple protocol versions for backward compatibility.

### Version Comparison

| Feature | NitroRPC/0.2 (Legacy) | NitroRPC/0.4 (Current) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **State Updates** | Basic only | Intent-based (OPERATE, DEPOSIT, WITHDRAW) |
| **Add Funds to Active Session** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (DEPOSIT intent) |
| **Remove Funds from Active Session** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (WITHDRAW intent) |
| **Fund Redistribution** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (OPERATE intent) |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Enhanced validation |
| **Modify Total Funds** | Must close & recreate | Can update during session |
| **Recommended For** | Legacy support only | All new implementations |

:::caution Protocol Version Selection
The protocol version is specified in the app definition during creation and **cannot be changed** for an existing session. Always use **NitroRPC/0.4** for new <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app sessions</Tooltip>.

## create_app_session

### Name

`create_app_session`

### Usage

Creates a new virtual application session on top of the <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balance</Tooltip>. An <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip> is a "box" or shared account where multiple <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> can lock funds and execute application-specific logic with custom governance rules. The app definition specifies <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip>, their voting weights, quorum requirements for state updates, and the protocol version. Funds are locked from <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants'</Tooltip> <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balances</Tooltip> for the duration of the session. <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App sessions</Tooltip> enable complex multi-party applications like games, prediction markets, escrow, and collaborative finance—all operating off-chain with instant <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> updates and zero gas fees.

### When to Use

When multiple <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> need to interact with shared funds and application <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> in a trustless manner. Examples include turn-based games, betting pools, escrow arrangements, DAOs, prediction markets, and any application requiring multi-signature <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> management.

### Prerequisites

- All <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> with non-zero initial allocations must be [authenticated](./authentication)
- All such <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> must have sufficient available balance
- All such <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> must sign the creation request
- Protocol version must be supported (NitroRPC/0.2 or NitroRPC/0.4)

## Governance Models

<Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App sessions</Tooltip> support flexible governance through custom weights and quorum configurations.

### Example 1: Simple Two-Player Game

```
Participants: [Alice, Bob]
Weights: [1, 1]
Quorum: 2

Result: Both players must sign every state update
Use case: Chess, poker, betting between two parties
```

**Governance**: Cooperative - both parties must agree to all changes.

### Example 2: Game with Judge

```
Participants: [Alice, Bob, Judge]
Weights: [0, 0, 100]
Quorum: 100

Result: Only judge can update state
Use case: Games where application determines outcome
```

**Governance**: Authoritative - application/judge has full control.

### Example 3: Multi-Party Escrow

```
Participants: [Buyer, Seller, Arbiter]
Weights: [40, 40, 50]
Quorum: 80

Result: Any 2 parties can approve
  - Buyer + Seller (80)
  - Buyer + Arbiter (90)
  - Seller + Arbiter (90)
Use case: Escrowed transactions with dispute resolution
```

**Governance**: Flexible 2-of-3 - any two can proceed, preventing single-party blocking.

### Example 4: DAO-like Voting

```
Participants: [User1, User2, User3, User4, Contract]
Weights: [20, 25, 30, 25, 0]
Quorum: 51

Result: Majority of weighted votes required (51 out of 100)
Use case: Collaborative funds management
```

**Governance**: Weighted majority - decisions require majority approval by stake.

### Example 5: Watch Tower

```
Participants: [Alice, Bob, WatchTower]
Weights: [40, 40, 100]
Quorum: 80

Result:
  - Normal operation: Alice + Bob (80)
  - Emergency: WatchTower alone (100)
Use case: Automated monitoring and intervention
```

**Governance**: Dual-mode - normal requires cooperation, emergency allows automated action.

:::tip Governance Flexibility
By adjusting weights and quorum, you can implement any governance model from fully cooperative (all must sign) to fully authoritative (single party controls) to complex weighted voting systems.

## Fund Locking Mechanics

When an <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip> is created, funds are locked from the <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balance</Tooltip>:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Alice's Unified Balance<br/>Total: 200 USDC<br/>Available: 200 USDC<br/>Locked: 0 USDC] 
    
    B[Create App Session<br/>Alice locks 100 USDC]
    
    C[Alice's Unified Balance<br/>Total: 200 USDC<br/>Available: 100 USDC<br/>Locked: 100 USDC]
    
    D[App Session<br/>Alice: 100 USDC<br/>Status: Open]
    
    A -->|create_app_session| B
    B --> C
    B --> D
    
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style B fill:#fff5e1
    style C fill:#e1ffe1
    style D fill:#ffe1f5
```

**Balance State Changes**:

```
Before Creation:
  Alice's Unified Balance:
    Total: 200 USDC
    Available: 200 USDC
    Locked: 0 USDC

After Creating Session with 100 USDC:
  Alice's Unified Balance:
    Total: 200 USDC
    Available: 100 USDC
    Locked: 100 USDC (in app session 0x98765...)
```

:::warning Locked Funds
Locked funds **cannot be transferred or withdrawn** until the <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip> closes. Only available balance can be used for [transfers](./transfers) or new <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app sessions</Tooltip>.
:::

### Signature Requirements

All <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> with non-zero initial allocations MUST sign the create_app_session request. <Tooltip content="A virtual ledger layer that provides a unified ledger (through Nitro RPC) and coordinates state channels (through Nitrolite), providing chain abstraction for developers and users">The clearnode</Tooltip> validates that:

1. All required signatures are present
2. Signatures are valid for respective <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip>
3. Total weight of signers >= quorum (must be met for creation)

---

## submit_app_state

### Name

`submit_app_state`

### Usage

Submits a <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> update for an active <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip>. State updates can redistribute funds between <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> (OPERATE intent), add funds to the session (DEPOSIT intent), or remove funds from the session (WITHDRAW intent). The intent system is only available in NitroRPC/0.4; version 0.2 sessions only support fund redistribution without explicit intent. Each <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> update increments the version number, and must be signed by <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> whose combined weights meet the quorum requirement. The allocations field always represents the FINAL <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> after the operation, not the delta.

### When to Use

During <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip> lifecycle to update the <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> based on application logic. Examples include recording game moves, updating scores, reallocating funds based on outcomes, adding stakes, or partially withdrawing winnings.

### Prerequisites

- <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App session</Tooltip> must exist and be in "open" status
- Signers must meet quorum requirement
- For DEPOSIT intent: Depositing <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip> must sign (in addition to quorum)
- For DEPOSIT intent: Depositing <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip> must have sufficient available balance
- For WITHDRAW intent: Session must have sufficient funds to withdraw
- Version must be exactly current version + 1

### Request

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description | Format | Example | Notes / See Also |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|--------|---------|------------------|

## Intent System (NitroRPC/0.4)

The intent system defines the type of operation being performed. Each intent has specific validation rules.

### Intent: OPERATE (Redistribute Existing Funds)

**Purpose**: Move funds between <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> without changing total amount in session.

**Rules**:
- Sum of allocations MUST equal sum before operation
- No funds added or removed from session
- Quorum requirement MUST be met
- Depositing <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip> signature NOT required

**Example**:

```
Current state (version 1):
  Alice: 100 USDC
  Bob: 100 USDC
  Total: 200 USDC

Update (version 2, intent: "operate"):
  Allocations: [
    {"participant": "0xAlice", "asset": "usdc", "amount": "75.0"},
    {"participant": "0xBob", "asset": "usdc", "amount": "125.0"}
  ]
  
Result:
  Alice: 75 USDC (-25)
  Bob: 125 USDC (+25)
  Total: 200 USDC (unchanged) ✓

Validation: Sum before (200) == Sum after (200) ✓
```

**Use Cases**:
- Record game outcome (winner gets opponent's stake)
- Update prediction market positions
- Rebalance shared pool
- Penalize or reward <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip>

:::tip OPERATE Intent
Use OPERATE for simple fund redistributions within the session. The total amount remains constant—funds just move between <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip>.
:::

---

### Intent: DEPOSIT (Add Funds to Session)

**Purpose**: Add funds from a <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant's</Tooltip> <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balance</Tooltip> into the session.

**Rules**:
- Sum of allocations MUST be greater than sum before operation
- Increase MUST come from available balance of depositing <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip>
- Depositing <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip> MUST sign (even if quorum is met without them)
- Quorum requirement MUST still be met
- Allocations show FINAL amounts (not delta)

**Example**:

```
Current state (version 1):
  Alice: 100 USDC
  Bob: 100 USDC
  Total: 200 USDC

Alice's Unified Balance:
  Available: 50 USDC

Update (version 2, intent: "deposit"):
  Allocations: [
    {"participant": "0xAlice", "asset": "usdc", "amount": "150.0"},
    {"participant": "0xBob", "asset": "usdc", "amount": "100.0"}
  ]
  Signatures: [AliceSig, QuorumSigs...]
  
Calculation:
  Alice deposit amount = 150 (new) - 100 (old) = 50 USDC
  
Result:
  Alice: 150 USDC (100 + 50 deposited)
  Bob: 100 USDC (unchanged)
  Total: 250 USDC (+50) ✓
  
Alice's Unified Balance After:
  Available: 0 USDC (50 moved to session)
  Locked: +50 USDC

Validation:
  - Sum after (250) > Sum before (200) ✓
  - Alice signed ✓
  - Alice had 50 available ✓
```

**Use Cases**:
- Top up game stake mid-game
- Add collateral to escrow
- Increase position in prediction market
- Buy into ongoing game

:::caution DEPOSIT Intent
**Critical Understanding**: The allocations array shows FINAL amounts, not the deposit amount. <Tooltip content="A virtual ledger layer that provides a unified ledger (through Nitro RPC) and coordinates state channels (through Nitrolite), providing chain abstraction for developers and users">The clearnode</Tooltip> calculates the deposit by comparing previous and new allocations for each <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip>.
:::

---

### Intent: WITHDRAW (Remove Funds from Session)

**Purpose**: Remove funds from session back to a <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant's</Tooltip> <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balance</Tooltip>.

**Rules**:
- Sum of allocations MUST be less than sum before operation
- Decrease is returned to <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant's</Tooltip> available balance
- Withdrawing <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip> signature NOT specifically required (quorum sufficient)
- Quorum requirement MUST be met
- Allocations show FINAL amounts (not delta)

**Example**:

```
Current state (version 1):
  Alice: 150 USDC
  Bob: 100 USDC
  Total: 250 USDC

Update (version 2, intent: "withdraw"):
  Allocations: [
    {"participant": "0xAlice", "asset": "usdc", "amount": "150.0"},
    {"participant": "0xBob", "asset": "usdc", "amount": "75.0"}
  ]
  Signatures: [QuorumSigs...]
  
Calculation:
  Bob withdrawal amount = 100 (old) - 75 (new) = 25 USDC
  
Result:
  Alice: 150 USDC (unchanged)
  Bob: 75 USDC (100 - 25 withdrawn)
  Total: 225 USDC (-25) ✓
  
Bob's Unified Balance After:
  Available: +25 USDC
  Locked: -25 USDC

Validation:
  - Sum after (225) < Sum before (250) ✓
  - Quorum met ✓
```

**Use Cases**:
- Cash out partial winnings mid-game
- Remove collateral when no longer needed
- Take profits from shared investment
- Reduce stake in ongoing game

---

## Version Management

Every <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> update MUST increment version sequentially:

```
Initial state: version 1
First update: must submit version 2
Second update: must submit version 3
...
```

**If submitted version doesn't match expected version + 1**:
- Request is rejected
- Error: "Version conflict"
- Client should fetch current <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> and retry

:::warning Version Conflict Prevention
Version management prevents concurrent update conflicts and ensures total ordering of <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">states</Tooltip>. This guarantees all <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> see the same sequence of <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> transitions.
:::

---

## Quorum Validation

For every update, <Tooltip content="A virtual ledger layer that provides a unified ledger (through Nitro RPC) and coordinates state channels (through Nitrolite), providing chain abstraction for developers and users">the clearnode</Tooltip> validates quorum:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Receive State Update] --> B{Calculate Total Weight}
    B --> C[Sum weights of all signers]
    C --> D{Total Weight >= Quorum?}
    D -->|Yes| E[✓ Update Accepted]
    D -->|No| F[✗ Reject: Quorum Not Met]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5ff
    style E fill:#e1ffe1
    style F fill:#ffe1e1
```

**Validation Logic**:

```
totalWeight = sum of weights for all signers
if (totalWeight >= definition.quorum) {
  ✓ Update accepted
} else {
  ✗ Reject: "Quorum not met"
}
```

**Example** (using Game with Judge scenario):

```
Participants: [Alice, Bob, Judge]
Weights: [0, 0, 100]
Quorum: 100

Valid signature combinations:
  - Judge alone: weight = 100 >= 100 ✓
  - Alice + Bob: weight = 0 >= 100 ✗
  - Alice + Bob + Judge: weight = 100 >= 100 ✓
```

## close_app_session

### Name

`close_app_session`

### Usage

Closes an active <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip> and distributes all locked funds according to the final allocations. Once closed, the <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip> cannot be reopened; <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> must create a new session if they want to continue. The final allocations determine how funds are returned to each <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant's</Tooltip> <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balance</Tooltip> (available state). Closing requires quorum signatures. The final session_data can record the outcome or final <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> of the application. All funds locked in the session are released immediately.

### When to Use

When application logic has completed and <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> want to finalize the outcome and retrieve their funds. Examples include game ending, escrow condition met, prediction market settled, or any application reaching its natural conclusion.

### Prerequisites

- <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">App session</Tooltip> must exist and be in "open" status
- Signers must meet quorum requirement
- Final allocations must not exceed total funds in session
- Sum of final allocations must equal total session funds

### Request

## Fund Distribution on Closure

When an <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain">app session</Tooltip> closes, funds return to <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants'</Tooltip> <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode">unified balances</Tooltip>:

```
Before Closure:
  Alice's Unified Balance:
    Total: 200 USDC
    Available: 100 USDC
    Locked: 100 USDC (in app session 0x98765...)

App Session 0x98765:
  Alice: 100 USDC
  Bob: 100 USDC
  Total: 200 USDC

Close with final allocations:
  Alice: 180 USDC
  Bob: 20 USDC

After Closure:
  Alice's Unified Balance:
    Total: 280 USDC (200 + 80 won)
    Available: 280 USDC
    Locked: 0 USDC
    
  Bob's Unified Balance:
    Total: 20 USDC (100 - 80 lost)
    Available: 20 USDC
    Locked: 0 USDC (was 100)
```

### Allocation Rules

1. **Must Sum to Total**:
   - `sum(final_allocations) MUST equal sum(current_allocations)`
   - Clearnode validates this; cannot create or destroy funds during close

2. **Can Be Zero**:
   - <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">Participants</Tooltip> can receive zero in final allocation (lost everything)
   - Example: Losing player in a winner-takes-all game

3. **Must Account for All Participants**:
   - Every <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participant</Tooltip> in definition should have an entry (even if zero)
   - Omitted <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> are treated as receiving zero

4. **Can Include Non-Financial Participants**:
   - Example: Judge/application can receive commission
   - `{"participant": "0xJudge", "asset": "usdc", "amount": "5.0"}`

## Closure Examples

### Example 1: Chess Game

```
Initial:
  White: 100 USDC
  Black: 100 USDC
  Judge: 0 USDC
  Total: 200 USDC

Final (White wins):
  White: 190 USDC (won 90)
  Black: 0 USDC (lost 100)
  Judge: 10 USDC (5% commission)
  Total: 200 USDC ✓
```

### Example 2: Escrow (Buyer Satisfied)

```
Initial:
  Buyer: 100 USDC
  Seller: 0 USDC
  Arbiter: 0 USDC
  Total: 100 USDC

Final (Successful delivery):
  Buyer: 0 USDC
  Seller: 99 USDC (payment)
  Arbiter: 1 USDC (fee)
  Total: 100 USDC ✓
```

### Example 3: Escrow (Dispute, Buyer Refunded)

```
Initial:
  Buyer: 100 USDC
  Seller: 0 USDC
  Arbiter: 0 USDC
  Total: 100 USDC

Final (Arbiter ruled for buyer):
  Buyer: 95 USDC (refund minus fee)
  Seller: 0 USDC
  Arbiter: 5 USDC (dispute fee)
  Total: 100 USDC ✓
```

### Example 4: Prediction Market

```
Initial:
  User1: 50 USDC (bet YES)
  User2: 50 USDC (bet YES)
  User3: 40 USDC (bet NO)
  Oracle: 0 USDC
  Total: 140 USDC

Final (Outcome: YES):
  User1: 68.25 USDC (split pot proportionally)
  User2: 68.25 USDC
  User3: 0 USDC (lost)
  Oracle: 3.50 USDC (2.5% fee)
  Total: 140 USDC ✓
```

:::success Final Distribution
All <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">participants</Tooltip> receive funds according to the final allocations, whether they won, lost, or served as neutral parties (judges, arbiters, oracles). The total is always preserved.

## Error Cases

| Error | Description | Recovery |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Authentication required** | Caller not authenticated | Complete [authentication](./authentication) |
| **App session not found** | Invalid app_session_id | Verify session ID |
| **Already closed** | Session status is "closed" | Cannot reopen; create new session |
| **Version conflict** | Version != current + 1 | Fetch current state, retry with correct version |
| **Quorum not met** | Sum of signer weights < quorum | Add more signers or adjust governance |
| **Intent not supported** | Intent in v0.2 session | Use v0.4 or omit intent field |
| **Invalid intent** | Unknown intent value | Use "operate", "deposit", or "withdraw" |
| **OPERATE: Sum changed** | Total different after operation | Ensure sum(new) == sum(old) |
| **DEPOSIT: Not signed** | Depositing participant didn't sign | Add depositor's signature |
| **DEPOSIT: Insufficient balance** | Depositor lacks funds | Reduce deposit or add funds |
| **WITHDRAW: Insufficient funds** | Session lacks funds to withdraw | Reduce withdrawal amount |
| **Unknown participant** | Allocation references unknown address | Use only defined participants |
| **Unknown asset** | Asset not supported | Use `get_assets` for supported assets |
| **Negative amount** | Amount < 0 in allocations | Use positive amounts only |
| **Missing field** | Required field absent | Include all required fields |

## Implementation Notes

**State Management**:
- Always use `intent: "operate"` for simple redistributions
- Always specify FINAL allocations, never deltas
- <Tooltip content="A virtual ledger layer that provides a unified ledger (through Nitro RPC) and coordinates state channels (through Nitrolite), providing chain abstraction for developers and users">The clearnode</Tooltip> computes deltas internally by comparing with previous <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip>
- Version numbers must be strictly sequential
- The session_data field can be updated in any intent

**Performance**:
- Updates are instant (< 1 second) and off-chain
- Zero gas fees for all operations
- All updates are logged for audit trail

**Notifications**:
- <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel">Participants</Tooltip> are notified via WebSocket of <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data">state</Tooltip> changes
- Closed sessions remain queryable for history

**Irreversibility**:
- Closure is instant and atomic
- All funds released simultaneously
- Once closed, cannot be reopened
- To continue, create a new session
