# Terminology

## Core Concepts

**Channel**: A secure communication pathway between participants that locks funds in an on-chain smart contract while enabling off-chain state updates.

**State**: A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data.

**Participant**: An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel. Typically includes a Creator (user) and a Clearnode or Clearnode Operator.

**Clearnode**: A virtual ledger layer that provides a unified ledger (through Nitro RPC) and coordinates state channels (through Nitrolite), providing chain abstraction for developers and users.

**Creator**: The participant at index 0 in a channel who initiates channel creation. The Creator constructs the channel configuration, prepares the initial funding state, signs it (signature at position 0), and calls the on-chain `create()` function to lock their funds and establish the channel. Typically a user or light client opening a payment channel with a clearnode.

**App Sessions**: Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain.

**Unified Balance**: An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by a clearnode.

**Session Key**: A temporary cryptographic key delegated by a user's main wallet that provides a flexible way for the user to manage security of their funds by giving specific permissions and allowances for specific apps.

## Identifiers

**channelId**: A unique identifier for a channel, computed as the hash of the channel configuration.

**stateHash**: A cryptographic hash of a channel state, used for signature verification.

**requestId**: A unique identifier for an RPC request, used for correlating requests and responses.

**appSessionId**: A unique identifier for an app session, formatted as a 0x-prefixed hex string (32 bytes). Used for all subsequent operations on that specific app session.

**accountId**: An identifier for an account or app session within the unified ledger. Can be either a 0x-prefixed hex string or a wallet address.

**chainId**: A blockchain network identifier (uint64). Examples: 1 (Ethereum Mainnet), 137 (Polygon), 8453 (Base), 42161 (Arbitrum One), 10 (Optimism).

**assetSymbol**: A lowercase string identifier for a supported asset (e.g., "usdc", "eth", "weth", "usdt", "dai", "wbtc"). Asset symbols are consistent across chains.

**walletAddress**: A user's blockchain address (0x-prefixed hex string, 20 bytes) that identifies their account and owns funds. Used to identify participants in channels and app sessions.

**userId**: Identifies a user after authentication with a clearnode. Currently, this is always equivalent to the user's walletAddress.

## On-Chain Contracts

**Custody Contract**: The main on-chain contract implementing channel creation, joining, closure, and resizing. It is an implementation of the Nitrolite protocol that locks funds, tracks channel state, and coordinates with adjudicators to validate state transitions.

**Adjudicator**: A smart contract that defines the rules for validating state transitions during disputes. The adjudicator's `adjudicate()` function is called by the Custody contract to verify whether a new state is valid based on previous states and application-specific logic. Examples include SimpleConsensus (requires both signatures) and Remittance (only sender must sign).

## Protocol Components

**Nitrolite**: The on-chain smart contract protocol.

**Nitro RPC**: The off-chain communication protocol.
