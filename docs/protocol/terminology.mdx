# Terminology

## Core Concepts

**Channel**: A secure communication pathway between participants that locks funds in an on-chain smart contract while enabling off-chain state updates.

**State**: A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data.

**Participant**: An entity (identified by an address) that is part of a channel. Typically includes a Creator (user) and a Broker (service provider).

**Adjudicator**: A smart contract that validates state transitions according to application-specific rules.

**Broker**: An RPC message broker (also called Clear Node or Yellow Node) responsible for managing the off-chain protocol and providing services to clients.

**Creator**: Most often a light client willing to fund a ledger account with the Broker.

**Virtual Ledger Channel (VLC)**: Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, also called App Sessions.

**Unified Balance**: An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by the Broker.

**Session Key**: A temporary cryptographic key delegated by a user's main wallet to enable gasless transaction signing.

## Identifiers

**channelId**: A unique identifier for a channel, computed as the hash of the channel configuration.

**stateHash**: A cryptographic hash of a channel state, used for signature verification.

**requestId**: A unique identifier for an RPC request, used for correlating requests and responses.

## Protocol Components

**Nitrolite**: The on-chain smart contract protocol.

**Nitro RPC**: The off-chain communication protocol.

**Custody Contract**: The main on-chain contract implementing channel creation, joining, and closure.
