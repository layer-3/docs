# Architecture

## System Overview

The <Tooltip content="The on-chain smart contract protocol.">Nitrolite</Tooltip> protocol architecture consists of multiple layers working together to enable scalable, secure <Tooltip content="A secure communication pathway between participants that locks funds in an on-chain smart contract while enabling off-chain state updates.">state channel</Tooltip> operations:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Application["Application Layer"]
        APP[Chess, DEX, Gaming, Payments, Custom Logic]
    end
    
    subgraph OffChain["Off-Chain Layer (Fast Updates)"]
        CLIENT[Client SDK]
        BROKER[Clearnode]
        RPC[Nitro RPC WebSocket]
    end
    
    subgraph OnChain["On-Chain Layer (Smart Contracts)"]
        CONTRACTS[Custody Contracts]
    end
    
    subgraph Blockchain["Blockchain Layer"]
        CHAIN[Ethereum, Polygon, etc.]

## Communication Patterns

### Channel Opening

The <Tooltip content="A secure communication pathway between participants that locks funds in an on-chain smart contract while enabling off-chain state updates.">channel</Tooltip> opening process follows a coordinated sequence between client and <Tooltip content="A virtual ledger layer that provides a unified ledger (through Nitro RPC) and coordinates state channels (through Nitrolite), providing chain abstraction for developers and users.">a clearnode</Tooltip>:

1. Client requests channel creation from <Tooltip content="A virtual ledger layer that provides a unified ledger (through Nitro RPC) and coordinates state channels (through Nitrolite), providing chain abstraction for developers and users.">a clearnode</Tooltip> via <Tooltip content="The off-chain communication protocol.">Nitro RPC</Tooltip>
2. The clearnode returns signed initial <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data.">state</Tooltip>
3. Client submits transaction to <Tooltip content="The underlying distributed ledger technology (e.g., Ethereum).">blockchain</Tooltip>
4. The clearnode joins the channel on-chain
5. Channel becomes active

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Clearnode
    participant Blockchain
    
    Client->>Clearnode: create_channel request
    Clearnode->>Client: signed initial state
    Client->>Blockchain: submit create() transaction
    Blockchain->>Clearnode: Created event
    Clearnode->>Blockchain: submit join() transaction
    Blockchain->>Clearnode: Opened event
    Clearnode->>Client: channel_update notification
```

:::success Cooperative Opening
Channel opening requires cooperation between both parties, ensuring mutual agreement before funds are locked.
:::

### Off-Chain Updates

Off-chain updates occur entirely between <Tooltip content="An entity (identified by a wallet address) that is part of a channel.">participants</Tooltip> without touching the blockchain:

1. Participants exchange signed <Tooltip content="A snapshot of the channel at a point in time, including fund allocations and application-specific data.">state</Tooltip> updates via <Tooltip content="The off-chain communication protocol.">Nitro RPC</Tooltip>
2. No blockchain transactions required
3. Latest valid state maintained off-chain
4. Can be checkpointed on-chain at any time

:::tip Zero Gas Fees
Off-chain updates are instant (< 1 second) and incur zero gas fees, enabling high-frequency operations.
:::

### Channel Closing

Channels can be closed in two ways:

**Cooperative Closure**:
1. All participants sign final state
2. Any participant closes on-chain with signed final state
3. Fast and gas-efficient (1 transaction)

**Non-Cooperative Closure**:
1. Challenge-response mechanism resolves disputes
2. Requires challenge period for security
3. More expensive but works when parties disagree

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Active Channel] --> B{Parties Agree?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Cooperative Close<br/>Fast, Cheap]
    B -->|No| D[Challenge-Response<br/>Slow, Secure]

## Fund Flow

The following diagram illustrates how funds flow through the Nitrolite protocol:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[User Wallet<br/>ERC-20] -->|deposit| B[Custody Contract<br/>Available]
    B -->|create/join| C[Channel<br/>Locked]
    C -->|off-chain updates| D[Unified Balance<br/>Clearnode]
    D -->|app sessions| E[Virtual Channels<br/>Application]
    E -->|close session| D
    D -->|close channel| B
    B -->|withdraw| A
    
    style A fill:#90EE90
    style B fill:#87CEEB
    style C fill:#FFD700
    style D fill:#DDA0DD
    style E fill:#FFA07A
```

**Flow Explanation**:

1. **Deposit**: User deposits ERC-20 tokens into <Tooltip content="The main on-chain contract implementing channel creation, joining, and closure.">Custody Contract</Tooltip>
2. **Lock**: Funds move from "available" to "locked" when <Tooltip content="A secure communication pathway between participants that locks funds in an on-chain smart contract while enabling off-chain state updates.">channel</Tooltip> is created/joined
3. **Off-Chain**: Locked funds become part of <Tooltip content="An abstraction that aggregates a user's funds across multiple blockchain networks, managed by Clearnode.">unified balance</Tooltip>, managed off-chain
4. **App Sessions**: Funds can be allocated to <Tooltip content="Off-chain channels built on top of payment channels, intended to be used by app developers to enable application-specific interactions and transactions without touching the blockchain.">app sessions</Tooltip> for applications
5. **Release**: When app sessions close, funds return to unified balance
6. **Unlock**: When channel closes, funds return to custody "available" balance
7. **Withdraw**: User withdraws funds back to their wallet

:::caution Security Guarantee
At every stage, funds remain cryptographically secured. Users can always recover their funds according to the latest valid signed state, even if the clearnode becomes unresponsive.
